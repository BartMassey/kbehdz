# kbehdz: Command Pattern crate
Copyright (c) 2018 Bart Massey

This is a crate implementing the "Command Pattern"
<http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html> in Rust
using "function pointer" trait objects. The intent is to be
able to map keycodes / events to actions and run those
actions in a game context.

(The name "kbehdz" was literally chosen randomly, because
Cargo and name conflicts and name-squatting.)
